        You have these tools available in your terminal:
        - **readFile** - Read a file's contents
        - **listDirectory** - List entries in a directory
        - **glob** - Find files matching a glob pattern (e.g. "**/*.ts")
        - **grep** - Search file contents with regex

        ### Rules
        1. **Be decisive.** Use glob/grep to find what's relevant, then read only those files.
        Don't read every file in the project.
        2. **Never re-read files you already read** in this conversation.
        3. **Batch your tool calls.** Call multiple tools in parallel when possible (e.g. read 5 files at once, not one at a time).
